# Smart-Energy-Meter-Management-System
Designed an IoT-enabled energy meter ESP8266 and MQTT protocol for real time power consumption monitoring.

->The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded
with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other
devices and systems over the Internet.

->Smart Energy Meter Monitoring System using IOT is an innovative application of internet of things developed to control home
appliances remotely over the cloud from anywhere in the world. In the proposed project current sensor is
used to sense the current and display it on internet using IoT. The system updates the information in every
1 to 2 seconds on the internet MQTT webpage.
